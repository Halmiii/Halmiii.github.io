<p>Hello Visitor, I am Halmina Ganggan.</p>

<p>I am from sibutu. I studied BS in Criminology at Mahardika Institute of Technology INC., Bongao, Tawi-Tawi. I worked as a volunteer for COVID-19 close contacts at Department of health, republic of the philippines.</p>

<p>I am a lazy person who likes surfing internet or watching movies and listening songs. I love spending time with my friends and family. I am also fond of travelling and taking pictures of nature. I usually spend my time at beach or port. Obviouslly I can swim. I hate reading books, it makes me sleepy. But i can't ignore one person who keep on talking about space which i really hate. </p>

<p> My dream is to be a police woman so my boyfriend will be afraid of leaving me. :p </p>
